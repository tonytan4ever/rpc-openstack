# Elasticsearch versions
# NOTE (alextricity25):
# The elasticsearch version variables needs to be available to the repo_build role
# due to the way it builds out the distro packages dataset. Distro packages within
# a role are indexed using their raw form(jinja is not rendered). The repo_build
# role then attempts to render these datasets, and will fail if it cannot resolve
# a variable. Putting these variables in here ensures the repo_build
# role can interpolate the variables correctly.
